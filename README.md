This is my personal repository that holds most of my early projects for java programming.  

Most of these projects can also be found online.

Project 1: Budget Allocation

This program takes an amount in US dollars and asks the user for 3 different percentages to allocate their budget.  If the percentage adds more than 100 percent, the program will automatically adjust itself to the correct remaining percentage out of 100 percent.


Project 2: Investment Earnings

This program involves a common stock investing that asks the user for an initial deposit in US dollars.  After this initial deposit, the user is asked for the closing stock price each day.  If the closing price is higher than the initial deposit, the program will display the amount you have either gained or lost by using the mathematical formula: closing stock price - initial deposit.
