This is my personal repository that holds most of my early projects for java programming.  

Most of these projects can also be found online.

Project 1: Budget Allocation

This program takes an amount in US dollars and asks the user for 3 different percentages to allocate their budget.  If the percentage adds more than 100 percent, the program will automatically adjust itself to the correct remaining percentage out of 100 percent.
